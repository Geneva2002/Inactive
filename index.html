            <p>Hey, everyone...</p>
            
            <p>There's something I need to say, and it's not easy. From now on, I've decided to step away from gaming (SAMP) and even Discord. This wasn't a simple choice, but I believe it's a necessary step because I need to focus entirely on the <span class="highlight">real world</span> - a world filled with responsibilities, dreams, and bigger purposes.</p>
            
            <p>I want to say the biggest thank you to all of you who have been part of my journey, through the fun times and the tough moments. Every laugh, every late-night conversation, even the small arguments, they've all become precious memories that I'll always cherish. I'm sorry if I've ever let any of you down with my words or actions.</p>
            
            <p>To those who've sent me messages or DMs and didn't get a reply, please understand. It's not because I don't care, but because I'm trying to change, grow, and become a better version of myself.</p>
            
            <p>Maybe someday, our paths will cross again at a different time, with new stories to share. Until then, take care of yourselves, stay strong, and keep chasing your dreams!</p>
            
            <p>Thank you for everything. Until we meet again.</p>
